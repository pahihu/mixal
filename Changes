        - io.c, run.c: track idle time waiting for I/O to complete
        - run.c: instruction execution trace, memory dump

180118AP
        - run.c: memory_fetch/store, safe_fetch/store checks incomplete I/O
                 MOV changes elapsed_time, do_scheduled_io() takes into account
        - symbol.c: MinGW has stricmp()
        - io.c: buffers are protected for write/read access
                output operation locks buffer for READ
                input operation locks buffer for WRITE
                buffers cannot overlap, except for output operations
                safe_fetch/store enforces this access for the MIX CP as well

        - io.c: go device, reader/punch/printer could redirected to files
                only tape/disk/drum device files contains device numbers
        - run.c: go device support, execute IN 0(U), start from 0
        - main.c: switches
                -g device       set GO device
                -h              help
                -r              redirect reader/punch/printer to files
        - run.c,io.c: busy I/O devices, simulated I/O time
        - run.c: flush outstanding I/O at HLT
        - added mixref.pdf

        - changed delta, sigma, gamma to ~, [, #
        - charset.c: card cannot read/punch: sigma, gamma, $, <, ...
                     (20, 21, 49, 50, ...)
        - io.c: overpunch (11-punch) in card reader
        - driver.c: ALF is a synonym to CON
        - parse.c: parse_expr() do not clobber overflow
