# mixal
Based on [MIXAL](http://github.com/darius/mixal) from Darius Bacon.

Changes:

  * tape devices
  * time dependent I/O
  * card reader/punch and printer can use files instead of stdin/stdout
  * reference card (see mixref.pdf)
  * overlapping I/O buffer checks, incomplete I/O detection
  * MinGW port

**NOTE**: Use the code! Good luck!
